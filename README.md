West House Project
===

**This is currently a work in progress. But we hope to be able to have an elegant solution for maintaining the West House Project.**

The entire West House Project, in one repo.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/westhouseproject/whp
$ cd whp
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

You should be able to edit any of the projects.
